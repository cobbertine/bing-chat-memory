# Bing Chat Memory

## About

Normally, conversations are wiped when the user terminates a session with Bing Chat. This web app allows the user to instruct Bing Chat to save a conversation for future reference, the user can then create a new session in the future but still refer to previous information which Bing Chat will know about as it's stored on the page. I had this idea a little while ago, but I wasn't sure how to implement it until I came across "Indirect Prompt Injection Threats" on https://greshake.github.io/.


A video of this web app can be seen here:
